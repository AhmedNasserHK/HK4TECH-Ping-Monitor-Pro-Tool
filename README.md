# HK4TECH-Ping-Monitor-Pro-Tool
(HK4TECH Ping Monitor Pro Tool)
is a graphical ping utility for monitoring multiple hosts. Numerous host monitors can be added and removed, and each monitor dynamically resizes with the application window. Color-coding allows you to tell at a glance the status of each host. In addition to standard ICMP pings, you can also perform a TCP 'port ping', where the application continuously connects to a specified port and displays whether or not the port is open. A fast trace route utility and a basic packet generator / stress tester is also included.

## üòÉ Features :

* Quickly and easily ping multiple hosts.
* Color coding allows you to instantly determine the status of each host. Green means up. Red means down. Orange means error.
* Each host monitor dynamically resizes and scales with the applications window.
* Options to configure the interval between each ping, the timeout, TTL, and message size.
* Monitor TCP ports. vmPing will continuously connect to a given TCP port and will display whether the port is open or closed. Enter HOSTNAME:PORT for the hostname. Example - WebserverA:80
* Option to log everything to a text file.
* Option to log only status changes to a text file. A status change is when a host you are pinging goes down, or a down host comes back up.
* Popup notifications to alert you of status changes.
* Email notifications on status changes.
* All colors can be customized.
* Favorites. Easily save a collections of hosts to be recalled instantly at a later time.
* Aliases. You can assign a friendly display name for any given host.
* Traceroute. For the hostname, enter T/HOSTNAME to perform a traceroute.
* DNS forward and reverse lookups. For the hostname, enter D/NAME_OR_IP to perform a DNS lookup.
* Specify any number of hosts from the command line to instantly begin pinging when the application opens.
* Specify a file containing a list of hosts to load and instantly ping when the application launches.
